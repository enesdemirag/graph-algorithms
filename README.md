For any necessary information about this project first read the [assignment](assignment.pdf). This projects consist of a Graph class with methods like Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). Below commands can be used to build and run this project with *g++*.

```
>> g++ -std=c++11 q1.cpp -o q1
>> ./q1
>> city_plan_1.txt
```

```
>> g++ -std=c++11 q2.cpp -o q2
>> ./q2
>> path_info_1.txt
```

All of the standard libraries used in this project is given below.

```
<algorithm> : To find element positions inside lists and vectors.
<iostream>  : To print things to the terminal.
<fstream>   : To read things from a file.
<sstream>   : To parse sub strings
<climits>   : To assign the maximum integer value.
<string>    : String operations.
<vector>    : Storing some elements and accessing them.
<tuple>     : To store three values in a pack.
<set>       : Storing unique elements.
<map>       : Mapping pairs of elements.
```

I explained my decisions and way of thinking in depth via inline documentation and comments inside this project. You can also test these programs using [calico tool](https://github.com/itublg/calico) with given [q1.t](q1.t) and [q2.t](q2.t) scripts. If you encounter any problem regarding this projects, feel free to reach me.

Sincerely, Enes.
